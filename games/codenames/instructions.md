Each team takes turns trying to guess the secret identities of their own agents working off of a single word clue from their spymaster.

The spymaster may only utter a single word as a clue and a number. The number that they may say is the number of cards on the board that this clue applies to. If there are codenames that say “pig” and “farm” then the spymaster might say “livestock:2”. The spymaster must keep a straight face and give no other clues.

The spymaster may use 0 to indicate that “none of our words use this clue”. In this case the agents are allowed unlimited guesses.

The spymaster may also indicate “unlimited” as their number. This also allows unlimited guesses. The disadvantage is that the agents won’t know how many words relate to the clue that was just given.

Agents attempt to guess which codename(s) correspond to the present or previous clue(s) given. Once the agents of that team decide on a single tile, the agents tap it with their finger, and then the spymaster checks their answer against the key and places the corresponding card (agent, assassin, bystander) over the top of the codename (and leaves it there).

If your own agent is revealed, then your team has guessed correctly and may guess again, but not receive another clue. They may guess up to the limit imposed by the spymaster but may always add one extra guess. The agents may also decide not to pick a card and pass the turn.

If the agents contact the wrong color, then the turn passes and the agent is revealed for the other team.

If a bystander is revealed then the turn is passed.

If the assassin is revealed then that team loses instantly. The game is over.
